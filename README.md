# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification

# Task To do
We are provided with data of Cassava plant images that are labelled and we need to use these in order to build a classifier that would help the farmers in determining which plant has been infected and which type of disease it is. This would help them to take the right measures to stop crop failure. </br>

# Dataset

As this was a Kaggle contest the data that was provided by Makerere University AI Lab. The data set had 21367 labeled images that we would use to build our classifier. These images were taken by the farmers in their gradens and no special equipment was used to capture the plants. <br/>

# Results

The results obtained were not very great as we used a classic CNN approach to build our model. Using the something like EfficientNet or Inception-Resnet would have made the model much better. I will be making a model using InceptionResnet and Efficient net as well and will update the repo with same once it is done. <br/>
